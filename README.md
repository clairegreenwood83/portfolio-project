# portfolio-project



# Description

I designed and built this portfolio to collate and showcase the web development projects I have undertaken. I hope this portfolio will provide a clear idea of my deisgn and web development capabilities. 

# Portfolio sections

The portfolio presents my name, avatar and a navigation bar which links to sections about my, my work and my contact information. Within the section entitled work there are titled images of my applications which when clicked link the user to the deployed application. The webpage has been designed to have a responsive layout and is adaptable, being able to be viewed on a range of different screen sizes.
